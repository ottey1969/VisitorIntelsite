Step 2: Modify static/js/main.js (Frontend - JavaScript)
This file handles the display of individual message timestamps. We need to ensure that the timestamp received from the backend (which is UTC) is correctly converted to the user's local timezone.
Open static/js/main.js in your Replit editor.
Locate the formatTimestamp function. You mentioned this function exists and converts UTC to local time. Let's inspect and modify it.
Original (likely similar to this):
javascript
formatTimestamp(timestamp) {
    // Assuming timestamp is a string like 'HH:MM PM'
    // This needs to be updated to handle ISO format and timezone conversion
    return timestamp; // Placeholder, actual logic will vary
}
Change the formatTimestamp function to correctly handle ISO 8601 UTC strings and convert them to local time:
javascript
formatTimestamp(isoTimestamp) {
    if (!isoTimestamp) return '';
    try {
        // Create a Date object from the ISO 8601 string
        // JavaScript's Date constructor handles ISO 8601 strings correctly,
        // interpreting 'Z' or '+00:00' as UTC and converting to local time.
        const date = new Date(isoTimestamp);
        
        // Format to local time (e.g., 07:00 PM)
        return date.toLocaleTimeString('en-US', {
            hour: 'numeric',
            minute: '2-digit',
            hour12: true
        });
    } catch (e) {
        console.error('Error formatting timestamp:', e, isoTimestamp);
        return 'Invalid Time';
    }
}
Now, ensure that addMessageToDisplay (or wherever message timestamps are rendered) calls this formatTimestamp function.
Find the line in addMessageToDisplay that sets the message-timestamp:
javascript
                <span class="message-timestamp text-muted me-2">${message.timestamp}</span>
Change it to:
javascript
                <span class="message-timestamp text-muted me-2">${this.formatTimestamp(message.timestamp)}</span>
Explanation: This ensures that every message timestamp, which is received as an ISO UTC string, is passed through the formatTimestamp function, which will correctly convert it to the user's local time for display.
